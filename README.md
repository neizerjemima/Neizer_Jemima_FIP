# Name of the Project
Website design for a desktop and mobile display


TODO: Write a project description
The website I designed was a retail website. A site map and wireframe was used to give the idea of how
the website should or would look like after it has been coded. Visual studio code was used to write the html and css
code for the website. The written code was occationally passed thourgh an html and css validator. 

## Installation
The process used in designing the website was it been written with code. Html was used to write the content of the
page and css was used to style it. I tried my best to depict what i had done in my wireframe into code.

part of the website that can be clicked on if it were responsive.
